你可以使用Godot游戏引擎打开我的项目，gd后缀的是代码文件，tscn后缀是场景文件

This is a 2D side - scrolling fighting and level - clearing indie game developed using the Godot game engine. The author is a college student who spent approximately 60 hours during the winter vacation to complete it. Currently, the first level and the frameworks of subsequent levels of this game have been set up, and the enemy templates are also ready.

You can open my project with the Godot game engine. The files with the ".gd" suffix are code files, and those with the ".tscn" suffix are scene files.

The materials in the scene files are all from open - source authors on the website https://itch.io.
